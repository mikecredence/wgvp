# wgvp - WearGait video-to-pose pipeline

[![tests](https://github.com/mikecredence/wgvp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mikecredence/wgvp/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Gait-laboratory video usually shows more than the participant: staff at a desk, a clinician walking alongside,
people passing in the background. The participant is the one wearing the inertial sensors. wgvp uses that fact to
turn a two-camera session video plus its sensor recording into per-frame 3D body poses of the participant alone.

It runs entirely on the data owner's own computer, needs no network, and ships only **pose-level derivatives**
(SMPL-X body parameters, 2D skeleton keypoints without face points, bounding boxes, sync offsets, QC numbers).
No video frame leaves the site. It was built for the [WearGait-PD](https://doi.org/10.7303/syn52470130) session
videos (two camera views tiled into one frame beside the IMU/walkway CSV export), and the folder-matching rules,
sensor column names and task names are all in one editable JSON file, so other labs' layouts are a configuration
change.

*Both camera views of the bundled synthetic session (rendered bodies, no real people). Green is the person the
pipeline chose from the pelvis accelerometer; the co-walker, the seated operator and the bystander stay grey.*

## What it does

For each session video (one file, two views tiled side by side or stacked, unequal sizes and letterboxing are fine):

1. **Finds the two view panels** in the frame (black borders plus the persistent content seam).
2. **Tracks every person in each view** with a 2D pose tracker (CPU).
3. **Picks the subject**: the person whose pelvis up-and-down motion matches the pelvis accelerometer in the
   recording CSV. Seated or standing people do not match however large they are in frame; the two views are matched
   jointly; the subject's exits from a view are recorded as gaps instead of being filled with a bystander.
4. **Syncs** the video to the recording timeline with the same cross-correlation (the video frame of IMU t = 0, with
   a confidence), cross-checked against a sync light if one is visible, a Video Labeler label export if present, and
   an annotation-sheet start frame if present.
5. **Lifts the subject to SMPL-X body parameters** per frame and per view with [GVHMR](https://github.com/zju3dv/GVHMR)
   (the only GPU step), driving the lifter with the subject's own bounding boxes so it follows the right person.
6. **Reconciles the two views** on the IMU timeline, writes a QC record per recording and view, skeleton-only
   thumbnails, and one QC summary page across all sessions.

![two views](docs/figures/two_views_tracking.png)

*Two frames of the synthetic session with the detected panels (green and orange boxes), every tracked person and,
beside each, that person's pelvis correlation with the IMU at the shared lag. The subject reaches 0.74-0.77; the
co-walker, who starts 0.8 s later, 0.03-0.17; the seated operator and the bystander about 0.1.*

## Quick start

Python 3.10-3.12 on Windows, macOS or Linux. Everything below runs on the CPU.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikecredence/wgvp.git
cd wgvp
python -m venv wgvp-env
source wgvp-env/bin/activate        # Windows: wgvp-env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That is the whole CPU install (numpy, scipy, OpenCV, CPU PyTorch, ultralytics, a bundled ffmpeg). The tracker
weights (`weights/yolov8n-pose.pt`, 6 MB) and a synthetic test session (`sample/`, 3 MB) are in the repository.
`pip install -e .` additionally gives you a `wgvp` command equal to `python -m wgvp`.

**1. Dry run (3-6 min on a laptop CPU).** The bundled session has a known answer; every check must pass:

```bash
python -m wgvp dry-run --cpu-only
```

```
  [PASS] two panels detected at the right boxes
  [PASS] sync offset within 2 frames of truth (pelvis cross-correlation): estimated 3.009 s vs true 3.0 s ...
  [PASS] left: chosen track is the rendered subject: 99% of 1442 frames within 36 px of the GT hip ...
  [PASS] right: the subject's exits are recorded as gaps (no bystander attached)
  ...
DRY RUN PASS (11/11 checks)
```

**2. Example corpus on real footage.** Three public YouTube clips (a gym walk, a corridor shuttle-walk test with
two standing staff, a crowded plaza) are fetched to your machine, cut, and given a fabricated sensor recording made
from the walker's own motion, so the whole pipeline can be exercised on real video without any real IMU. See
[examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for what each one shows and what to expect.

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
python examples/fetch_examples.py          # add --cookies-from-browser chrome if YouTube asks for a sign-in
python -m wgvp run examples/data --cpu-only
python examples/verify_examples.py
```

**3. Your own data.** Point the pipeline at the top-level folder that holds the subject folders:

```bash
python -m wgvp scan /path/to/data_root       # what was found, what was not, and why
python -m wgvp run  /path/to/data_root --cpu-only
```

or open the GUI (`python -m wgvp`): choose the data folder, **Scan**, **Dry run**, **Run all sessions**,
**Open QC summary**. The GUI needs tkinter, which the python.org installers include; on Debian/Ubuntu
`sudo apt install python3-tk`.

**4. The GPU step** (GVHMR, NVIDIA GPU with 8 GB or more, CUDA 12) lives in its own Python environment:
[env/install_gvhmr.md](env/install_gvhmr.md). Once it exists, `python -m wgvp check-gpu --gvhmr-root <GVHMR>
--gvhmr-python <that env's python>` lists every missing piece with its fix, and `python -m wgvp run <root>` (without
`--cpu-only`, with `gvhmr.root` / `gvhmr.python` set in the config or passed as flags) runs the lift after the CPU
stages. The CPU stages can be run now and the GPU stage later (`python -m wgvp gvhmr <root>`).

## Expected input

```
<data root>/
  <subject>/                        e.g. NLS036   (folder name pattern: subject_folder.regex in wgvp_config.json)
     <subject>_selfpace.csv         recording CSVs = the WearGait IMU/walkway export (Time, GeneralEvent, LowerBack_FreeAcc_*, ...)
     <subject>_selfpace_mat.csv
     SP/<subject>_SP_<tags>.mp4     one combined two-view video per task (task from the file-name token or the folder name)
     (optional) *label*.csv         Video Labeler scene labels exported in video time (sync cross-check)
     (optional) *annot*.csv         annotation sheet with a video start frame (sync cross-check)
```

Only the self-paced family is processed by default (`selfpace`, `selfpace_mat`, `selfpace_matturn`); add other
tasks in `wgvp_config.json` under `tasks`. A video is paired with every recording CSV of its task family for that
subject and the sync stage reports which recording the video actually holds, so one long video per visit and one
video per trial both work. Single-view videos work too (`"views": {"layout": "single"}`).

The first `scan` writes `wgvp_config.json` into the data root with every matching rule (subject-folder pattern,
task names, CSV and video name patterns, panel boxes per video, selection thresholds, GVHMR paths). Edit it and scan
again; no code changes are needed for a different naming convention.

Label export for the optional cross-check, in MATLAB with the labeler session open or the `gTruth` object loaded:

```matlab
T = timetable2table(gTruth.LabelData); writetable(T, 'NLS036_SP_labels.csv');
```

## How the subject is found and synced

Every tracked person gets a *pelvis signal*: the hip row relative to the camera's horizon row, divided by the
torso length, which removes the perspective term that walking toward a low camera leaves in the raw hip row. The
IMU side is the pelvis accelerometer, band-passed to the gait band (0.5-5 Hz) and integrated twice, so both sides
are pelvis displacement. A coarse match on the activity envelope (the stand / walk / turn pattern) finds the
candidate lag, a fine match inside +-0.75 s gives the correlation-versus-lag curve per person, and since the two
views are one file with one unknown lag, the lag is chosen jointly: the one that the most fragments across both
views support. The same lag is the sync offset, to sub-frame precision.

![selection and sync](docs/figures/selection_and_sync.png)

*A: inside a walk bout the subject's video pelvis signal (green, both views) follows the accelerometer (black); the
co-walker's (red) does not. B: correlation versus lag for every scored person; the subject's fragments peak at the
shared lag of 3.01 s (true 3.00 s). C: coverage per view on the IMU timeline; the side view's two exits become gaps.*

Correlations are judged by their **excess over an empirical chance level**, not by their raw value. Short fragments
reach high correlations by chance (a 4-s fragment reaches r = 0.73 over a full-range lag search; a 45-s one 0.30),
so the acceptance rule is r >= 0.30 *and* excess >= 0.15, and a "high" confidence further needs r >= 0.35, excess
>= 0.20 and a margin >= 0.12 over the best other person at that lag. On crowded public footage with a simulated
reference, subjects visible for 8 s or more were found in every tested case among 300-400 other walkers, 4-8-s
fragments about half the time (otherwise mostly declared low-confidence), with 11 ms median offset error
([docs/design.md](docs/design.md), section 2.4). A clinic recording gives 20-45 s of the subject per view with a
stand / walk / turn pattern, which is the easy regime.

## Where tracking goes wrong, and what the pipeline does about it

Multi-person tracking in a room fails in known ways. Each one is handled, and each leaves a trace in the QC so you
can see it happened.

| Failure | What the pipeline does | Where you see it |
|---|---|---|
| The tracker swaps identities when two people cross or pass close | Tracker ids are split into **fragments** at box jumps, time gaps and persistent appearance changes; fragments are judged one by one and re-joined only when they agree on the shared lag | `n_fragments`, `subject_tracks` (the accepted fragment ids) |
| An identity switch inside one fragment (the subject and a co-walker crossing) | A **lag-consistency mask**: the fragment's pelvis signal is correlated with the IMU in 10-s windows at the shared lag; windows below r = 0.25 are dropped | `consistency` in `selection_joint.json` (kept fraction per fragment) |
| The subject leaves a view and someone else is in frame | Exits are recorded as **gaps**; nothing is attached while the subject is out, and a scorable fragment that contradicts the lag is never attached by appearance | `n_gaps`, `present_frac`, `gaps_imu_time_s`; the dry run asserts "no bystander attached" |
| Brief re-entries too short to score | Attached by torso-colour appearance only when clearly closer to the subject than to any concurrent person | `attached_by_appearance` |
| Two detection boxes on one person (partial bodies in the along-walkway view) | Recognised by box overlap and not counted as a rival | role `duplicate_of_subject` in the fragment table |
| Someone walking in step with the subject (a clinician alongside) | The pelvis match is sub-frame; a person 0.8 s behind correlates 0.03-0.17 at the shared lag. This is the one configuration where the margin gets thin | `margin`, `lag_ambiguity` (> 0.85 means another lag was almost as well supported) |
| A seated operator large in frame, a bystander at the far wall | No gait-band pelvis oscillation, so they score about 0 whatever their size | their `r_at_lag` in the fragment table |
| Short spurious fragments chaining up at a wrong lag with "high" confidence | Every correlation is judged by its excess over the chance level for its length and the number of lags searched; support = excess x overlap, so one long genuine match outweighs a chain of short ones | `excess`, `second_best_excess` |
| The lifter follows the largest or longest person instead of the subject | GVHMR is driven with the subject's own bounding-box track (`preprocess/bbx.pt`), cut per view and per visible stretch | `gvhmr_frames` versus `present_frac` |
| The two views disagree after all this | Reconciliation on the IMU timeline: residual lag of the 2D pelvis signals (always) and per-joint disagreement of the SMPL-X poses (after GVHMR), tolerance 3 frames | `reconcile_status`, `residual_lag_s`, `legs_median_deg` |
| The automatic choice is wrong or absent | Two operator tools: `set-roi` (draw the walkway polygon once per view) and `pick-subject` (click the subject on a skeleton-only frame); both are reported with their agreement with the automatic choice | `selection_source` = `walkway_roi` / `operator_pick`, status WARN |
| Variable frame rate, dropped frames | All timing is done on presentation timestamps, never on frame counts | `timing` in the video record (gaps, VFR flag) |

Two of these rules were learned the hard way while testing (the perspective term in the pelvis signal, and the
chance level of short fragments); [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) section 2.6 has the numbers before and after.

## The GPU step and the two-view agreement

GVHMR lifts each view independently; the pipeline only hands it the subject's cropped frames and boxes, converts
its output to NPZ on the IMU timeline, and then compares the two views, which share nothing but the sync.

![mesh](docs/figures/gvhmr_two_views_mesh.png)

![agreement](docs/figures/gvhmr_two_views_agreement.png)

*On the synthetic session, lifted on a Tesla T4: the two views' knee-flexion curves line up on the IMU timeline
(residual lag -73 ms, within the 3-frame tolerance) and the leg joints disagree by a median of 8.1 degrees. Body
shape differs between views, as expected from a per-frame estimate when one view truncates the body.*

GVHMR takes about 0.5 s per frame per view on a T4 (12-15 min for a 50-s view). Its weights and the SMPL / SMPL-X
body models are downloaded by you under their own licences (registration required for the body models; they are not
in this repository or the Docker image). `docker/` holds a CUDA 12.1 recipe pinned to the versions we ran; its build
is untested because our GPU box had no disk left for it.

Frame indices refer to the original combined video (`frame_idx`), times to its presentation timestamps (`pts_ms`),
and `imu_t_s = pts_ms / 1000 - offset_s` is the recording time.

![QC summary](docs/figures/qc_summary.png)

The QC summary has one row per recording and view. What good looks like:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `selection_source`, `r_fine`, `margin` | `imu_xcorr` with r_fine >= 0.35 and margin >= 0.12 over the next person = confident. `imu_xcorr(low)`, `walkway_roi`, `operator_pick` = WARN: check the thumbnails |
| `present_frac`, `full_frac`, `partial_frac`, `n_gaps`, `lag_ambiguity` | share of the recording with the subject in this view, fully / partly in frame (head or feet cut), how many exits; lag_ambiguity > 0.85 = another person matched nearly as well at another lag |
| `walk_bouts_ok` | annotated Walk bouts covered (>= 80 %) by at least one view / total; a recording needs at least one |
| `sync_source`, `offset_s`, `offset_frame` | pelvis cross-correlation; `(validated by flash,labels,sheet)` lists the agreeing cross-checks; `*_minus_xcorr_s` are the differences |
| `reconcile_status`, `residual_lag_s`, `legs_median_deg` | the two views after the sync: residual lag about 0 (tolerance 3 frames); median leg-joint disagreement after GVHMR |
| `gvhmr_frames` | frames lifted in this view |
| `status` | PASS / WARN (chosen but unconfirmed, or a cross-check disagrees) / FAIL (nothing chosen, no sync, lifter failed), with the reason in `flags` |

Every stage writes its record; failures are explicit messages that say what to do (`pick-subject`, `set-roi`,
`check-gpu`, the config key to edit).

## Command line

```
python -m wgvp                         GUI
python -m wgvp scan <root>             find sessions / recordings / videos; write wgvp_config.json
python -m wgvp run <root> [--cpu-only] [--only <session> ...] [--force] [--gvhmr-root .. --gvhmr-python ..]
python -m wgvp gvhmr <root>            the GPU stage alone, on pending chunks
python -m wgvp summary <root>          rebuild the QC summary
python -m wgvp dry-run [--cpu-only] [--out DIR]
python -m wgvp check-gpu --gvhmr-root <GVHMR> --gvhmr-python <python>
python -m wgvp set-roi <root> --session <id> --camera <view> --kind walkway|light
python -m wgvp pick-subject <root> --session <id> --recording <id> --camera <view>
```

Videos are tracked once and cached by file hash; re-running after a config change is fast.

## Privacy statement

* The software runs entirely on the data owner's computers; it has no network function and downloads nothing.
* The deliverable (`deliver/` folders and the QC summary) contains **no image or video data**: SMPL-X body-model
  parameters (joint rotations, body-shape coefficients, root position), 2D skeleton keypoints and bounding boxes of
  the consented subject only (face keypoints are blanked; other people in the room are not exported), scalar
  sync/QC values, logs, and skeleton-only PNG thumbnails drawn on a black background from keypoints. The panel
  previews are Canny edge maps of one frame with the view boxes drawn; drop `validation_bundle/panels/` if an IRB
  prefers.
* `privacy_check.json` in every validation bundle lists every delivered file and asserts the rule (no video/image
  files, no image-like arrays in NPZ files, PNGs are sparse skeleton renders). A session fails its privacy check
  otherwise. (The sparseness test is tuned for a room with a handful of people; a crowd scene can trip it, see the
  examples.)
* Intermediates with pixels (cut clips for the lifter, GVHMR's input copies) are written under `work/`, deleted by
  the lifter stage after use where GVHMR produced them, and stay on the machine in any case.
* Body-shape coefficients (`betas`) and gait kinematics are weak re-identifiers in principle; they are the data the
  analysis needs.

## What has not been tested on real clinic recordings

The pipeline was validated on a rendered two-view session with a known answer, on unit tests, and on real
multi-person public footage with a simulated sensor reference. It has not yet run on real clinic video against a
real IMU: the panel geometry of real encodes, the tracker under clinic lighting with sensor straps and
de-identification blur, GVHMR on real truncated bodies, and the Walk-label and annotation-sheet cross-checks are
exercised only on synthetic inputs. The decisive number, the subject's `r_fine` in real footage, comes out of the
first real run and is printed in the QC summary. [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) section 3 lists everything, and
section 4 the questions to settle with a dataset's owners before that run.
